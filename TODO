Bugs

* The variability charts won't display
* The "interactive" pane sometimes doesn't update; selection has some
  drawing glitches.
* Sometimes the plot doesn't update when changing the Mfg plate range
  minimum slidebar.  This is either a problem with grid.draw not
  rendering the plot, or with Shiny not displaying it.  This may be
  due to the dynamic updating behavior of Shiny.
* "Interactive" tab: Does not display data table any more!
