* Removed "Start times.csv" (not complete, not needed)
* Separated raw-data loading functions into a separate file.  Converted these to
more structured tibble tables.
* Created an "R/scripts" directory for one-time scripts; moved
embedded-msa-assembly.R there.
* Wrapped the "mfg-map.R" collation script around a function.
